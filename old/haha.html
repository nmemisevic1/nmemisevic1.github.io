In September 2018, I did some challenge on codility.com. Week later I got email that says I am in top 50 of 1200 contestants and invited to attend Hackathon in Eindhoven, NL.
With all costs covered, I went to Eindhoven and attended big Hackathon in ASML, 1st tech company in the world. I made some friends and had a pretty good time there.

I scraped all data I needed from a website that provides scores and stats. Then I started making my own parameters and in some really short time I had a result. It was not so bad, but still had a lot of to do. Then I included machine learning, logistic regression, to really make parameters work, and BAM! Betting whisperer started working with high accuracy. In 20 games he predicted 18 correctly which gives him accuracy percentage of 90%, which is really good.
